# MothmansManager.github.io
Code for the beginnings of a personal site to be developed over time. Showcasing past and future projects as well as a resume.
Multiple .html files for each page of the site.
End Goal is to have a user-friendly and aesthetic website that can be used to showcase my skills as well as highlight links and screenshots to other projects.
This site is for my own personal use only and not to be distributed as otherwise.
