            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am Cian Hodnett, a 21 year old programmer studying computer science.
                I'm a big fan of video games and sci-fi with an affinity for art and design.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I have a level 6 degree in Computer Science from Cork College of Commerce which I then used as a pathway into UCC.
                I'm currently in second year of Computer Science at UCC and hope to graduate in 2025.
            </p>
            <h2>Employment</h2>
            <p>
                I have been working since the age of 16 and have mostly been in the food & retail industries. 
                These taught me a lot about working in teams and working under intense time pressure.
