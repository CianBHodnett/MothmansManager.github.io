                    I'm a 21 year old programmer studying Computer Science in UCC. My love for technology runs deep, way back to when i was just a young kid pulling 
                    apart my electronic toys just to see how they worked. After discovering my parents old consoles I became obsessed with the seemingly endless 
                    possibilities of digital worlds and spend the next decade exploring them. 
                    I have deep love and admiration of vintage electronics such as CRTs and retro consoles as well as any <i>"legacy"</i> web visuals.
